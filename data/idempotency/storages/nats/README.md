Package `nats` implements idempotency storage using NATS JetStream key-value store. Provides distributed idempotency detection with TTL support
via NATS infrastructure.

## Bucket TTL

The bucket's key TTL (`WithMaxAge`) expires every key in the bucket, including keys written by other processes sharing it. When the bucket already
exists with a different key TTL, `New` returns `ErrBucketTTLMismatch` and leaves the bucket untouched instead of rewriting it under those processes.
Align the configuration, use another bucket, or pass `WithMigrateBucketTTL()` to update the existing bucket deliberately; through the idempotency
factory the switch is `storage.nats.migrateBucketTTL: true`. Migration applies the whole bucket config, so the limit-marker TTL moves to the new
`WithMaxAge` as well, and a bucket created without one gets per-key TTL enabled (NATS server 2.11+).
